# GuessMe
A litte android game for my girlfriend.
It shows a couple of our memorable photos and asks player which photo has been taken earlier.

It uses sftp access to my server with image database. The private key and hostname are stripped for this repository so it's not playable.
It uses the following external libraries:

* jsch - for sftp access
* metadata-extractor - for reading EXIF metadata
